# Express unit testing

A simple project to outline various unit testing methods of express routes.

The two files included are app.js, a file that contains the code that starts and runs the express app, this will not be tested as it doesnt includde any of our own logic and solely handles winding up express.
The other file is index.js, the single route with sub-routers that will be tested in this.

To facilitate testing the routes, I will use [SuperTest](https://github.com/ladjs/supertest) to try it out and bring it through its paces.

The bonus being getting some hands on experience testing express routes for future projects.
